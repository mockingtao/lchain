    "### **What is LangChain?**\n",
    "> LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**~~TL~~DR**: LangChain makes the complicated parts of working & building with AI models easier. It helps do this in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Integration**ÔºàÂäüËÉΩ‰∏äÁöÑÈõÜÊàêÔºâ - Bring external data, such as your files, other applications, and api data, to your LLMs\n",
    "2. **Agency** - Allow your LLMs to interact with it's environment via decision making. Use LLMs to help decide which action to take next\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why LangChain?**\n",
    "1. **Components**ÔºàÁªÑ‰ª∂Ôºâ - LangChain makes it easy to swap out abstractions and components necessary to work with language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Customized Chains** - LangChain provides out of the box support for using and customizing 'chains' - a series of actions strung together.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Speed üö¢** - This team ships insanely fast. You'll be up to date with the latest LLM features.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Community üë•** - Wonderful discord and community support, meet ups, hackathons, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though LLMs can be straightforward (text-in, text-out) you'll quickly run into friction points that LangChain helps with once you develop more complicated applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: This cookbook will not cover all aspects of LangChain. It's contents have been curated to get you to building & impact as quick as possible. For more, please check out [LangChain Conceptual Documentation](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/)*"

For people not sure what it\\'s doing, large language models (LLMs) are very powerful but they\\'re very general. As a common example for this limitation, imagine you want your LLM to answer questions over a large corpus.You can\\'t pass the entire corpus into the prompt. So you might:\\n- preprocess the corpus by iterating over documents, splitting them into chunks, and summarizing them\\n- embed those chunks/summaries in some vector space\\n- when you get a question, search your vector space for similar chunks\\n- pass those chunks to the LLM in the prompt, along with your questionThis ends up being a very common pattern, where you need to do some preprocessing of some information, some real-time collecting of pieces, and then an interaction with the LLM (in some cases, you might go back and forth with the LLM). For instance, code and semantic search follows a similar pattern (preprocess -> embed -> nearest-neighbors at query time -> LLM).Langchain provides a great abstraction for composing these pieces. IMO, this sort of \"prompt plumbing\" is far more important than all the slick (but somewhat gimicky) \"prompt engineering\" examples we see.I suspect this will get more important as the LLMs become more powerful and more integrated, requiring more data to be provided at prompt time.', metadata={'source': 'https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34422627', 'title': 'LangChain: Build AI apps with LLMs through composability'}),\n",

I\\'ve been internally calling these systems \"prompt machines\". I\\'m a strong believer that chaining together language model prompts is core to extracting real, and reproducible value from language models. I sometimes even wonder if systems like this are the path to AGI as well, and spent a full month \\'stuck\\' on that hypothesis in October.Specific to prompt-chaining: I\\'ve spent a lot of time ideating about where \"prompts live\" (are they best as API endpoint, as cli programs, as machines with internal state, treated as a single \\'assembly instruction\\' -- where do \"prompts\" live naturally) and eventually decided on them being the most synonymous with functions (and api endpoints via the RPC concept)mental model I\\'ve developed (sharing in case it resonates with anyone else)a \"chain\" is `a = \\'text\\'; b = p1(a); c = p2(b)` where p1 and p2 are LLM prompts.What comes next (in my opinion) is other programming constructs: loops, conditionals, variables (memory), etc. (I think LangChain represents some of these concepts as their \"areas\" -> chain (function chaining), agents (loops), memory (variables))To offer this code-style interface on top of LLMs, I made something similar to LangChain, but scoped what i made to only focus on the bare functional interface and the concept of a \"prompt function\", and leave the power of the \"execution flow\" up to the language interpreter itself (in this case python) so the user can make anything with it.https://github.com/approximatelabs/lambdapromptI\\'ve had so much fun recently just playing with prompt chaining in general, it feels like the \"new toy\" in the AI space (orders of magnitude more fun than dall-e or chat-gpt for me). (I built sketch (posted the other day on HN) based on lambdaprompt)My favorites have been things to test the inherent behaviors of language models using iterated prompts. I spent some time looking for \"fractal\" like behavior inside the functions, hoping that if I got the right starting point, an iterated function would avoid fixed points --> this has eluded me so far, so if anyone finds non-fixed points in LLMs, please let me know!I\\'m a believer that the \"next revolution\" in machine-written code and behavior from LLMs will come when someone can tame LLM prompting to self-write prompt chains themselves (whether that is on lambdaprompt, langchain, or something else!)All in all, I\\'m super hyped about LangChain, love the space they are in and the rapid attention they are getting~', metadata={'source': 'https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34422627', 'title': 'LangChain: Build AI apps with LLMs through composability'}),\n",
