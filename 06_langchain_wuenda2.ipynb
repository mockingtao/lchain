As the temperature increases, the emitted radiation shifts to shorter wavelengths and becomes more intense. This relationship between temperature and the distribution of emitted radiation is known as Planck\\'s black body radiation law.\\n\\nBlack body radiation has a characteristic spectrum that depends solely on the temperature of the object emitting it. At low temperatures, the radiation is mostly in the infrared range, while at higher temperatures, it extends into visible light and even ultraviolet or higher-energy regions.\\n\\nThis phenomenon has significant implications in various fields of physics, including astrophysics, quantum mechanics, and thermodynamics. The study of black body radiation has helped shape our understanding of the interaction between matter and radiation, leading to important applications in astronomy, spectroscopy, and the development of quantum theory.',\n",

Additionally, DNA is constantly being transcribed and translated in cells to produce the proteins needed for their specific functions.\\n\\nIn summary, every cell in our body contains DNA because it is the carrier of our genetic information, which is crucial for the development, function, and maintenance of our cells and overall body.'"
